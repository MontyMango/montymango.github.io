            <p>This is an attempt to create a program that checks to see if systems are awake and can be remoted into.
            This tool's main audience is system administrators, but can be used for other professions as well. </p>

            <h3>Python Blackjack</h3>
            <h6>Language: Python</h6>
            <p>It's blackjack written in Python! This was my take on creating blackjack in the command line!
                This game is still in its alpha form but will soon become fully playable!

            <h3>PinGuess.py</h3>
            <h6>Language: Python</h6>
            <p>Can you try to guess what 4 digit pin the computer selected in 5 moves?
                In this game you try to guess a randomly picked 4 digit pin in 5 moves.
                Right now I plan on re-writing PinGuess.py's code to make it easier to read and to modify.
